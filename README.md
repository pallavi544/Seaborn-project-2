# Seaborn-project-2
## About the Project
This project further explores the capabilities of Seaborn, a Python data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. Through a variety of plots, the notebook highlights how Seaborn can be used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), uncover trends, and represent statistical relationships within a dataset.

## Objectives
* Practice advanced plotting with Seaborn for deeper data analysis

* Create meaningful and visually appealing graphics with minimal code

* Leverage built-in themes, color palettes, and contextual options

* Gain insights into data distributions, relationships, and comparisons

## Visuals Covered
* Line Plot

* Count Plot

* Box Plot

* Violin Plot

* Pair Plot

* Heatmap

These visuals are selected to demonstrate Seaborn’s versatility and ability to convey statistical information in a digestible format.

## Technologies Used
* Python – Programming language

* Seaborn – Visualization library for statistical graphics

* Pandas – For dataset handling and preparation

* Matplotlib – Rendering engine and customization support

* Jupyter Notebook – Environment for building and sharing the analysis
